## 🎯 Motivation

The motivation to build geocoder emerged from a deep fascination with geospatial technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. After being inspired by the [MapScaping](https://www.mapscaping.com/) podcast and seeing the growing importance of location-based services, I recognized an opportunity to create a tool that simplifies geographic data handling.

### ✨ Features
